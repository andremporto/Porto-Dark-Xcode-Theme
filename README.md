# One Dark theme for Xcode

This is a port of the original [Atom One Dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) theme for Xcode.

## Installation

You can install the theme by downloading [One Dark.xccolortheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bojan/xcode-one-dark/master/One%20Dark.xccolortheme) and copying it to:

	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes

Note: If the folder doesn't exist, create it manually.

## Font

The theme uses the excellent open-source font [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
